      <li><strong>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive enhancement is essentially the steps it takes to complete an optimized web page or site. It starts with the HTML which is the content of the page. This is like the skeleton. After that is the CSS which makes everything look nice to the user. Once everything is formatted correctly, JavaScript is implemented. This allows certain functions to be added to the page. The article by Aaron Gustafson uses a peanut M&M as an example of this idea. I like to think of it as a house. The HTML is the foundation and structure. The CSS is the exterior and interior design. The JavaScript is the function of the house such as plumbing and lighting. Progressive enhancement is important because it focuses more on the content first. This allows for users with less advanced software to be able to see the content that is being updated. After that, more advanced layers of presentation and features are added on. These advanced features are available for those with more advanced technology. This way, everyone benefits.
