     <h2><strong>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</strong></h2>
     
       <p>Progressive enhancement is essentially the steps it takes to complete an optimized web page or site. It starts with the HTML which is the content of the page. This is like the skeleton. After that is the CSS which makes everything look nice to the user. Once everything is formatted correctly, JavaScript is implemented. This allows certain functions to be added to the page. The article by Aaron Gustafson uses a peanut M&M as an example of this idea. I like to think of it as a house. The HTML is the foundation and structure. The CSS is the exterior and interior design. The JavaScript is the function of the house such as plumbing and lighting. Progressive enhancement is important because it focuses more on the content first. This allows for users with less advanced software to be able to see the content that is being updated. After that, more advanced layers of presentation and features are added on. These advanced features are available for those with more advanced technology. This way, everyone benefits.

     <h2><strong>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</strong></h2>  
        <p>
          For my SpaceX project, I asked a friend of mine to look over it. The main thing he told me to work on is the visual aspect. He said that the home page should look more active. So what I did was add a slideshow of images using jquery. He also said that the FAQ page looked really ugly with the dotted dividers. I agreed. So I removed the dividers and made each block alternating colors using nth-child to make the page look smoother. I also turned the questions to bold so they don’t blend with the answers. I then noticed that I had a “read more” link that didn’t lead anywhere. So I fixed it and linked it to the actual SpaceX website.

          The most difficult part for me personally on this project was having to deal with the images. This includes resizing all the images to fit properly. The thing that frustrated me the most was the logo replacement. I spent so much time trying to fix things and searching google to see what I was doing wrong. Eventually I realized that I forgot to set it to display:block. I often find myself making this same mistake whenever I've coded in the past. It takes me forever to figure out why something isn’t working. It turns out to be a typo.

        I very much enjoyed this class. It was the one class where I felt that I was learning something useful and interesting. I really appreciate the course homepage and all its helpful links. I can’t count how many times I’ve gone back and forth looking for stuff to help me.
